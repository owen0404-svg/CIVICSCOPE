## 🌐 OVERVIEW

**Civicscope** is a game-changing platform meant to **visualize** and **simulate** city/urban architecture as well as give insight into a more sustainable and pollution free world. It is designed to **help people understand** how urban design, infrastructure and environmental policy help to shape the places we live in, as well as to highlight that some cities may not be built with sustainability in mind. Civicscope uses the very same methods that are used in real life to assess the urban sustainability of cities across the world. This platform combines **procedural generation**, 3D exploration using **Three.js** and real world sustainability metrics to create cities that are accurate to real life. Our project aims to simulate city conditions that are ideal for the growth and development of the city itself, alongside nature and the environment that we have slowly destroyed along the way. 
  
### ❗ The Problem

Modern cities, with the **endless growth** they experience from the increasingly rising exponential growth of capitalism and the industries, often come with a heavy cost. Cities all around the world  face increasingly complex challenges, where modern development usually ignores these challenges for the sake of **money and growth**. The problems are: 
  
- 🌫️ **Rising air pollution and carbon emissions**
- 🚗 **Poor urban layout** leading to congestion and inefficiency  
- 🧠 **Lack of public understanding** of how city design impacts sustainability  
- 📉 Urban planning data that is often **inaccessible, abstract, or difficult to visualize**

 
For most people, especially students and everyday citizens, urban planning feels like an exceptionally hard concept to grasp. Concepts that are key to urban planning, such as green infrastructure, power lines, bus routes, zoning, transport networks etc. These concepts are usually taught in rather abstract and theoretical ways, which makes it difficult to imagine and see how they connect to real life. Most would often wonder if these concepts would even hardly make the difference towards the sustainability of modern infrastructure. People usually hear that public transport, solar energy, bus routes, green infrastructure and to minimize cars may help with the environment, however, the average citizen would have no idea how these ideas may help the environment and shape certain discussions about the choices made to shape cities.

  
### 💡The Solution

**CivicScope** transforms the difficult concepts of urban planning into something **visually appealing, interactive, easily understandable and accessible**. Instead of focusing on the statistics, the theory and the practice of drawing or engineering the aspects of green infrastructure, our project aims to create and simulate cities.


## KEY FEATURES 

### 🗺️ Procedural Generation 

Our project aims to deliver unique experiences for each and every user, each and every time. This is why we implemented procedural generation that creates realistic looking city layouts. We aim to make our project as “alive” as possible, where just like in real life, no two cities would grow and develop into the exact same layouts.

### 📊  Interactive Information & Data Layers

Our project aims to be as accessible as possible, where we design our information to be simple, easy to read and easily understandable. Every part of the cities can be interacted with and show statistics grounded in the very same metrics used in urban planning and green infrastructure.

### 🌎 3D Designs 

Using Three.js, the cities generated from our project can not only be informative, but can also look more interesting and interactive. We have pushed the limits of Three.js in order to bring a delightful experience for users, where users are allowed to move through the city skylines or the city streets in order to make our project as stunning visually as possible.

### 🎯 Accuracy

We have created a simulation that is as accurate as possible, where we base the simulation on real-world statistics and our goals include creating even better versions of this project, that way we can show users 100% accurate simulations. We strive to create projects that are based in numbers and have meaningful results, not just random numbers

## 📍Transit and Route Simulation

Our project can generate bus, light rail, and metro routes that are not only optimized but made to be as accurate as possible. The routes generated are calculated to be the most optimal based on the layout and population. These transit systems show how public transportation is a key part in urban planning.

## 🌦️Weather and Day-Night Cycles 

Aside from the city planning and urban design features, we also included a few features to incite realism into our project. The weather cycle and the day-night cycle help users be more immersed in the project


## ⏳ THE FUTURE 

CivicScope was designed to be able to be further developed and grow. Such as our project can be expanded upon in many ways: 

- 💪🏻 Train our **AI** to be able to accurately assess city layouts
- ⚒️ Allow users the freedom to create **custom cities**, as well as give out an accurate review of the city
- 🔎 Add more content in making the cities generated be **accurate** and be packed with more **information**
